# Dashboard-with-Plotly-and-Dash
Project Overview: Automobile Sales Dashboard
This project involves the creation of a dashboard in Python, using the libraries Plotly and Dash. The goal of this dashboard is to analyze and visualize historical trends in automobile sales during different periods, with a focus on recession periods. Specifically, it aims to provide insights into how the sales of XYZAutomotives, a company specializing in automotive sales, were impacted during times of recession.

Key Features:
Data Analysis:

Analyze automobile sales trends using historical sales data, focusing on changes during recession periods.
Provide a comprehensive report of findings based on the analysis.
Interactive Dashboard:

The dashboard will have two main reports:
Yearly Automobile Sales Statistics: An overview of yearly sales data.
Recession Period Statistics: Insights on sales performance during periods of economic downturn.
User Interaction:

Two Dropdown Menus:
Report Type Dropdown: Allows users to select between "Yearly Statistics" and "Recession Period Statistics".
Year Selection Dropdown: This dropdown allows users to select a specific year for the yearly statistics report. It is enabled only when "Yearly Statistics" is selected and disabled when "Recession Period Statistics" is selected.
Libraries Used:
Plotly: For creating interactive, high-quality visualizations.
Dash: To build the web-based dashboard that presents the analysis in an interactive manner.
This dashboard is designed to offer valuable insights into how economic downturns affect automobile sales and to allow users to explore these trends through dynamic visualizations.

This program has been written as an assignment for the "Data Visualization with Python" course that I have completed on Coursera online learning platform and is part of the "IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate" by Coursera.
